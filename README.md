# Angry Vectors Activity

This repository contains a basic program making use of MinVR and the BasicGraphics library used in comp465 Interactive Computer Graphics at Macalester College.

The example replicates the AngryBirds game by launching a sphere projectile towards a set of blocks. Your task in this activity is to verify and correct any errors in the projectile motion.

You should:
* Draw the projectile's velocity vector using a basicgraphics line.
* Looking at the vector, confirm whether the velocity that it visualizes seems correct. If not, discuss with your partner why not.
* If it is not correct, correct the projectile motion. It may be helpful to learn more about the [physics of projectiles](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/vectors/Lesson-2/Horizontally-Launched-Projectiles-Problem-Solving).
